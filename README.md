<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Here's an almost blank template to get started. You can use this template to create a new repository for your data science project. It includes a `README.md` template, a `LICENSE.txt` with the MIT License, a `data` folder, a `notebooks` folder, a `src` folder, a `models` folder, a `reports` folder, a `visualizations` folder, and a `.gitignore` file.

The project does not include a `environment.yml` file for conda environment, or a `requirements.txt` file for pip environment, but you should highly consider using such files to keep track of your project dependencies. You can use the `conda env export > environment.yml` command to create a `environment.yml` file from your current conda environment, or the `pip freeze > requirements.txt` command to create a `requirements.txt` file from your current pip environment.

**Note:** The `.gitkeep` files are used to keep the empty folders in the repository. You can delete them if you want to, they are not necessary.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* install conda environment
  ```sh
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This is an example of how to show ways of obtaining results from the project.

1. Download data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
2. Run the data processing script
   ```sh
    python data_processing.py
   ```
3. Run the model training script
   ```sh
    python train.py
   ```
4. Run the model evaluation script
   ```sh
    python evaluate.py
   ```
5. Run the visualization script
   ```sh
    python visualize.py
   ```
_Alternatively, you can run the entire analysis in the notebook `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`._
