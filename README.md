<h2 align="center">Data Project on The Effect of COVID-19 Virus Infection on the Single-Cell Level</h2>
  <p align="center">
    As part of a 10 ECTS course, called "Data Project" (on our 4th semester of the Bachelor of Data Science), we've gotten the chance to work with Molekylær Medicinsk Afdeling (MOMA) on the same data set as used in the CELL paper "COVID-19 immune features revealed by a large-scale single-cell transcriptome atlas" by Xianwen Ren et al. 2021.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For the project discription check the PDF file titled:
"The effect of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus infection on the single-cell level"

Something about the data and the Github_data.zip. Data from Cell paper can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE158055)
Here's an almost blank template to get started. You can use this template to create a new repository for your data science project. It includes a `README.md` template, a `LICENSE.txt` with the MIT License, a `data` folder, a `notebooks` folder, a `src` folder, a `models` folder, a `reports` folder, a `visualizations` folder, and a `.gitignore` file.

The project does not include a `environment.yml` file for conda environment, or a `requirements.txt` file for pip environment, but you should highly consider using such files to keep track of your project dependencies. You can use the `conda env export > environment.yml` command to create a `environment.yml` file from your current conda environment, or the `pip freeze > requirements.txt` command to create a `requirements.txt` file from your current pip environment.

**Note:** The `.gitkeep` files are used to keep the empty folders in the repository. You can delete them if you want to, they are not necessary.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* install conda environment
  ```sh
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This is an example of how to show ways of obtaining results from the project.

1. Download data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
2. Run the data processing script
   ```sh
    python data_processing.py
   ```
3. Run the model training script
   ```sh
    python train.py
   ```
4. Run the model evaluation script
   ```sh
    python evaluate.py
   ```
5. Run the visualization script
   ```sh
    python visualize.py
   ```
_Alternatively, you can run the entire analysis in the notebook `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`._
